# A stepper motor projects
Note: Verilog files are inside the file
In this project, We study the properties of a stepper motor.  Design and create A simple processor that controls the stepper motor.

Included in our report the following items:

The stepper motor
1. The behavior of Stepper motor and his structure.
2. What is half and full step in the stepper motor
3. How many steps does a stepper motor have

Design
1. How to ceate a good design?
2. How to implement the top-level module and his components.
3. How to solving implementation problems.

Testing
    1.Create a Testing for top-level and sub-levels.
