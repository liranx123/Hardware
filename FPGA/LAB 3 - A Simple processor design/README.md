# A simple Processor project

Included in our report the following items:

Explain the high-level structure of the processor in simple words. Define the purpose of each block.

1. Explain the functionality of each FSM included in our processor.
2. Define which are the control signals, and explicitly define what 
   each one controls.
3. How to design and implement the processor by an existing skeleton?

Testing
1. Use functional simulation to verify that your code is correct.
2. Perform full functional simulation.
    We answer the question of: "if you are not testing all the cases: what assumptions did you use? How would you  test a processor?"
3. Perform full timing simulation.
