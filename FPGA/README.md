# FPGA projects

1. A Simple processor: A digital system that contains a number of nine-bit registers, a multiplexer, an adder/subtractor
unit, and a control unit (FSM).
2. Step motor controller: In this project, We study the properties of a stepper motor.  Design and create A simple processor that controls the stepper motor.
