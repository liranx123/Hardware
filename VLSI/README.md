# VLSI projects

1. Final project: Analysis of different architecture of DAC and develop driver circuit on Virtuoso.
2. Source follower project: using STB simulation, step response, phase margin.

3. Two-stage miller amplifier: using AC & DC & STB simulations, how to design a two-stage miller amplifier from specifications.
